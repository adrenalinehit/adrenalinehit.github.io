One way to do this is by developing mobile iOS applications in your L&amp;D time <em>(nice perk of working at SBG! - 10%)</em>. Not only will this help you understand the app development lifecycle, but it will also give you the opportunity to apply your knowledge and test your abilities (<em>like learning SwiftUI!</em>).</p>\n<p id=\"ember3267\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">To begin, it is important to have a clear idea of what your app will do and what its features will be (<em>good point, ChatGPT...thanks!</em>). This will serve as a roadmap for the development process and will help you stay focused and organised <em>(we all know that hobby projects can be paralysis by \"one last feature\"...just get it out there!)</em>.</p>\n<p id=\"ember3268\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">Once you have your idea, the next step is to set up your development environment (<em>yeh, so I'm really hoping that our iOS engineers here have already done this!</em>). This will typically involve installing Xcode &amp;<em> waiting for hours for a massive download to finish.</em> With Xcode, you can design the user interface of your app, write the code, and test it on a simulated device. <em>(yep, and with SwiftUI you even get live previews...!)</em></p>\n<p id=\"ember3269\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">The next step is to actually start building your app. This will involve writing the code that brings your idea to life. As you do this, it is important to keep in mind the principles of good app design <em>(these are often skipped in the early stages, as perfection is the antithesis of</em> <em>done!)</em>, such as ensuring that the user interface is intuitive and responsive.</p>\n<p id=\"ember3270\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">Once your app is complete (<em>wasn't that easy!</em>)<em>,</em> the next step is to test it thoroughly <em>(well, I'd have hoped you'd have been testing it as you went along....right?!).</em> This will involve running it on a simulated device and using it as a real user would. This will help you identify and fix any bugs or issues with the app. (<em>otherwise known as: create a testflight build and give it to your friends and colleagues!</em>)</p>\n<p id=\"ember3271\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">Finally, when your app is ready, you can submit it to the App Store for review <em>(err, hold your horses ChatGPT... you'll have to sign up to the Apple Developer programme...fortunately, we've got you covered - thanks L&amp;D fund!).</em> If it is approved <em>(in my case, highly unlikely first time around, but YMMV!),</em> it will be available for download to users around the world <em>(in reality there's loads more to think about here - store artefacts, privacy policies etc etc)</em>.</p>\n<p id=\"ember3272\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">In conclusion, developing mobile iOS applications in your L&amp;D (<em>and weekends and evenings once you get the bug!</em>) time is a great way to improve your skills and understand the app development lifecycle. Whether you are just starting out or are an experienced engineer, this <em>will</em> be a valuable learning experience.</p>\n<hr class=\"reader-divider-block__horizontal-rule\">\n<p id=\"ember3273\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\"><em>Not bad, ChatGPT, not bad!</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"ember3274\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__heading-2\"><em>Congratulations!</em></h2>\n<p id=\"ember3275\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">So really, this post is about saying a huge well done to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/megan-wynn-645a20148/\" id=\"ember3276\" class=\"ember-view\" tabindex=\"0\">Megan Wynn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-hill-70383b141/\" id=\"ember3277\" class=\"ember-view\" tabindex=\"0\">Ryan Hill</a> for shipping their own apps!

From starting at SBG with no Swift experience, it’s incredible that I’ve had the support and motivation to get to this point. I’ve loved the process of releasing an app, right from having the first idea of what my apps could do through to actually releasing them. It’s been great to see the whole lifecycle and see my ideas come to life, even if they are niche and small. I’ve learnt so much about the review and release process and whilst Apple love to throw a spanner in the works, it’s been really fun the whole way through! Thank you to everyone who has helped me along the way, and I look forward to carrying on and doing more in the future!</blockquote>\n<p><em>First published on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/celebration-mobile-app-development-shipping-nick-payne\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn</a> in December 2022 (before everyone was using AI!)</em></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>In my career leading multidisciplinary delivery teams, I’ve often guided people through the choice of remaining technical or pursuing management roles.</p><p>Some people start a role and clearly state that they want to remain technical. Many ask about career progression and the different directions they might take. This often involves conversations about team leadership or some form of management.</p><p>It often occurs with senior or lead engineers looking to take the next step up in their careers. As a colleague once said (paraphrasing badly), “In order to get paid more you have to take responsibility for something”. That something can often end up being people.</p><h1 id=\"does-it-suit-everyone\">Does it suit everyone?</h1>\n<p>No, far from it. Colleagues have often remarked that they couldn’t think of anything worse than having to manage people, take commercial decisions or plan projects. Some see it as a drain on their time that could be better spent writing code, performing analysis or testing. Some people like the predictability of tech…people are far from predictable!</p><h1 id=\"is-it-avoidable\">Is it avoidable?</h1>\n<p>Yes! 100%. At least, it should be.</p><p>Established companies have detailed technical levels through which you can progress. Google is a prime example. See <a href=\"https://levelsfyi.com/google-levels-salary/amp/\">https://levelsfyi.com/google-levels-salary/amp/</a></p><p>I’d recommend a conversation early in your role with your line manager. Make it clear that you have no interest in getting involved with the managerial side of business. That being said, also make it clear that you want to stay technical and become the go to person for x, y or z.</p><h1 id=\"is-it-sensible\">Is it sensible?</h1>\n<p>If you deeply understand something then the chances are you can explain it to someone else. Most people like imparting knowledge and therefore find themselves coaching or mentoring people (whether they’re junior or simply asking for advice).</p><p>As a manager, it’s highly rewarding to see people grow based on your counsel. It will be harder to juggle technical responsibilities and managerial tasks but you will learn useful new skills.</p><h1 id=\"who-does-it-benefit\">Who does it benefit?</h1>\n<p>Done well and consciously it should benefit everyone. You’ll gain an understanding of the conflicting pressures in business, you’ll hopefully see people develop under your guidance and still get to keep your hand in on the tech.</p><h1 id=\"pitfalls\">Pitfalls?</h1>\n<p>Without guidance you might end up being unhappy in your new role. You might have lost the technical aspects and you’ll have taken on tasks that divert your attention from things you’d rather be doing. You might not be a good manager of people, despite being technically excellent. You might alienate your colleagues who expect you to be able to do both your new and old roles simultaneously.</p><h1 id=\"half-way-house\">Half way house?</h1>\n<p>You might be better suited to a team lead or architect-style position.</p><h3 id=\"maybe\">Maybe….</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Run workshops for junior staff</li>\n<li>Get your name out into the tech community by attending conferences</li>\n<li>Write blog posts</li>\n<li>Speak at events</li>\n<li>Contribute to open source projects</li>\n<li>Your tech reputation increases, your company gets some free marketing and you get to remain technical. Win-win.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"my-experience\">My experience</h1>\n<p>I have taken the journey, gradually becoming less technically hands. (I still enjoy coding and tinkering with tech)</p><p>This happened for a number of reasons. The company was growing rapidly and someone needed to recruit new staff; complete project working that was being won &amp; I needed to be more customer facing to assist a non technical PM. This allowed me - in a variety of roles - to experience and develop skills in requirements gathering, drafting proposals, costing projects, monitoring P&amp;Ls, dealing with HR information, setting business strategy and forming relationships with suppliers (and everything else in between!).</p><p>It was great to broaden my skill set and not just confine myself to solving technical problems. It was a conscious decision.</p><p>How have you dealt with this career choice? Are you facing it currently? I’d be interested to hear your experience.</p><p>Thank you for reading.</p><p>(First posted on Medium 4th March 2019, pre-ai revolution)\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/@adrenalinehit/to-manage-or-not-to-manage-that-is-the-question-4c6c7320d624\">https://medium.com/@adrenalinehit/to-manage-or-not-to-manage-that-is-the-question-4c6c7320d624</a></p>",
